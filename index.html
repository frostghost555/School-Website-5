I am also aware there is still great uncertainty about what conditions will be in August and what new challenges may develop along the way. We continue to monitor, consult with, and follow guidance from the State of California, Alameda County Public Health, Alameda County Office of Education, and the City of Fremont. While some restrictions are being scaled back, the possibility remains for a surge in COVID-19 cases and we will plan accordingly. A review of the Task Force’s work will be presented to the FUSD Board of Education at its July 8th meeting. I encourage you to tune in and learn more about the District’s efforts.
